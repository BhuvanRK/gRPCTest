# gRPC Test App

This is a simple golang based gRPC application. It implenents an api interface defined via Protobuf. The client and the server talk to each other over HTTP/2 and exchange a string foo-bar message. 

# To be done :

  - Add SSL/TLS integration
  - Add unit-tests, integration-tests and acceptance tests 
  - Add reverse-proxy for REST clients
